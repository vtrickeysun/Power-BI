ðŸš—ðŸ“Š Excited to Showcase My Latest Power BI Project: Car Sales Analysis Data! ðŸ“ŠðŸš—

Iâ€™m thrilled to share my recent work on a detailed car sales analysis using Power BI. This project highlights several key areas:

ðŸ”¹ Weekly Trend Sales Analysis: Visualized trends over time to identify peak sales periods and fluctuations.

ðŸ”¹ Car Model Wise Sales Analysis: Analyzed sales performance for various car models to pinpoint customer preferences and model success.

ðŸ”¹ KPI Comparison: Compared key performance indicators (KPIs) from the past year to the current year, including percentage changes, to assess performance improvements and areas needing attention.

ðŸ”¹ Car Dealer Wise Sales Analysis: Evaluated sales data across different dealers to understand regional performance and dealer-specific trends.

Transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights has been incredibly rewarding. This analysis not only provides a comprehensive view of sales dynamics but also supports strategic decision-making for optimizing sales and improving performance.
